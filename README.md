NER-FAM: Named Entity Recognition with Faceted Aggregation for Multimedia Software

# Description: 
This software aggregates disjoint media-specific repositories and links the data by identifying key information from a text corpus and categorizing the information into multiple mutually inclusive streams. These streams are further linked with the user's intended stream(s) via a modified BM24F ranking algorithm to personalize and diversify the search results.

# Libraries required are included in the notebook source code file
